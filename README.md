# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
After a school board found evidence of academic dishonesty among the grades of one of the district schools, a chief data scientist for the city school district has given us the following tasks to complete the school district data analysis.

1. Replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
2. Repeat the school district analysis and recreate the following metrics:
    - The district summary
    - The school summary
    - The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    - The average math score for each grade level from each school
    - The average reading score for each grade level from each school
    - The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.
3. Describe how these changes affect the overall analysis.
